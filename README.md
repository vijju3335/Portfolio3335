## Documentation
This course is the longest of the program clocking in at 33.5 hours. It was made up of five blocks:

* Sizing Elements
* Intro to HTML and CSS
* Responsive Web Design Fundamentals
* Responsive Images

Below is a short summary of each block; just be adviced that this in no way is a comprehensive or detailed explanation of the content covered.

### Sizing Elements
The first block covered [the CSS box model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Box_Model/Introduction_to_the_CSS_box_model) and [semantic elements in HTML5](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5). It was followed by a related problem set.

### Intro to HTML and CSS
The second block started with a repetition of HTML, CSS, and Boxes. Responsive layout and CSS Frameworks were introduced and a framework for responsive layouts were created.

### Html

The Html consists of differnet tags mainly 
```bash
 <html>, <head>, <body> 
 ```
 body again divided into 
 ```bash
  <header>, <main>, <footer> 
 ```
### Css

it have some selectors they are clearly explained here [CSS_HERE](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/)
It then dealt with other frameworks, including [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/). To segment the knowledge of Bootstrap many quizzes were given. Finally went through how to customize Bootstrap to include only selected features and why minified versions are prefered.

### Responsive Web Design Fundamentals
The third block started off with a discussion about why responsiveness matters and several web sites were showed on mobile. Then showed how to set up the workflow using [Chrome's Dev Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools) for device emulation as well as remote debugging on mobile devices.

It then explained why starting small and building up is the way to go, covering things like pixelation, DPR, CSS pixels, viewports and relative sizes. Targets and tap target sizes were also discussed.

The fourth lesson in this block covered common responsive layouts and how these make the transition from design to code a lot easier. The patterns covered were column drop, mostly fluid, layout shifter, and off canvas.

### Repsonsive Images
The first lesson was a short repetition covering the importance of responsive images and how to setup remote debugging on mobile.

The second lesson covered different ways to size images with CSS. It also introduced some lesser known CSS units. Apart from this it treated different types of images, like JPEG, PNG and SVG, and when to use which and why. Lastely it described how to optimize images and the related workflow using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).

The third lesson covered using markup as images. It covered everything from CSS background images, [Unicode symbol characters](http://unicode-table.com/en/#control-character) to [icon fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

The fourth and last lesson covered how to make fully responsive images using [the image element srcset and sizes attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img), the [picture](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/picture) and [source](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/source) elements. It also covered accessibility with regard to images.
